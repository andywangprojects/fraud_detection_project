    </ol>
</p>
    <section id="coef-ci">
  <h3>Confidence Interval of Coefficients</h3>

  <h4>Baseline Fraud Risk (~1.8 %)</h4>
  <p>
    This is the model’s “starting point” probability of fraud when all input factors
    (amount, category, gender, job frequency, age) are at their reference level
    (i.e. zero on your scaled/encoded scale). Converting the intercept (–3.99) into a
    probability gives about <strong>1.8 %</strong>, meaning that without any other information,
    the model would guess just under a 2 % chance of fraud.
  </p>

  <h4>Confidence Intervals (CIs)</h4>
  <p>
    A 95 % confidence interval is a range around each coefficient that shows how precise
    that estimate is. If the range doesn’t cross zero, we’re reasonably sure (95 % confident)
    that the real effect isn’t just random noise. In my results, all intervals stayed
    either entirely above or entirely below zero, so each factor has a real impact on fraud risk.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Feature Effects</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Transaction Amount (amt):</strong>
      Higher amounts increase fraud risk. Every one-unit jump in your scaled amount
      raises the odds of fraud by about <strong>58 %</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Merchant Category (category_Code):</strong>
      Some categories are slightly safer. Moving up one code reduces fraud odds by
      about <strong>15 %</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gender (gender_le):</strong>
      Depending on how you coded it, going from 0→1 increases fraud odds by roughly
      <strong>23 %</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Job Frequency (job_freq):</strong>
      This feature nearly guarantees non-fraud in your data—higher values push fraud
      probability toward zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Age (age_scaled):</strong>
      Older customers have a slightly higher fraud risk, with each unit of scaled age
      adding about <strong>16 %</strong> to the odds.

    <h3>📊 Key Takeaways</h3>

    </h4>Reading Materials:</strong><h4>
      <li><a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/roc-curves-auc" target="_blank">ROC Curves & AUC</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://builtin.com/data-science/precision-and-recall" target="_blank">Precision and Recall</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>What Is an ROC Curve and AUC?</h4>
    <p>An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) measures a classifier’s performance by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various thresholds. AUC (area under the ROC curve) represents the probability that the classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one.</p>

    <h4>Why Choose the ROC Curve?</h4>
    <p>AUC is <strong>threshold-invariant</strong> (the metric’s value does not depend on a particular decision threshold) and <strong>scale-invariant</strong> (the metric evaluates ranking quality rather than absolute score values).</p>

    <h4>Trade-off Between TPR and FPR</h4>
    <p>If your goal is to identify as many true positives as possible, you pursue a high TPR, which may come at the cost of a higher FPR—meaning false positives become more frequent. And vice versa.</p>

    <h4>Personal Insights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>TPR</strong> indicates the proportion of actual positives that the model correctly predicts as positive. <strong>FPR</strong> indicates the proportion of actual negatives that the model incorrectly predicts as positive.</li>
      <li><strong>Precision</strong>: Of all samples predicted positive (TP + FP), what fraction are truly positive (TP).</li>
      <li><strong>Recall</strong>: Of all actual positive samples (TP + FN), what fraction did the model correctly predict as positive (TP).</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>🔑 Evaluating the Logistic Regression Model: Confusion Matrix, ROC & AUC, and PR Curve</h3>

    <h4>Confusion Matrix</h4>
<img src="confusion_metric.jpg" width="700" ></li>

    <h4>ROC Curve</h4>
  <img src="ROC Curve.png" width="700" ></li>
    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> An AUC of 0.84 means that in 84% of random fraud–non-fraud pairs, the fraud transaction gets a higher score. This indicates good general discrimination, but it doesn’t tell you how many false alarms you’ll get at a working threshold.</p>

    <h4>PR Curve</h4>
 <img src="PR Curve.png" width="700" ></li>
    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> An Average Precision of 0.19 means that—even though you can rank frauds relatively well—the model’s practical precision is low: when it flags a transaction as fraud, it’s correct only 19% of the time on average.</p>


    </p>
    <h3>📝 Comment</h3>
    <p>Although the model achieves strong overall discriminative power (ROC-AUC = 0.84), precision on the minority class remains low (AP = 0.19), so logistic regression is not an effective tool to predict credit card fraud.</p>
  </div>
</section>
  </p>
  <!-- Random Forest -->
<div id="random-forest">
  <h3>2️⃣ Random Forest</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using the Random Forest with only class_weight='balanced', the model achieved a precision of 0.84 and a recall of 0.69. This configuration prioritized reducing false negatives, only correctly flagging 69% of fraudulent transactions while maintaining a high level of precision.</li>
          <img src="rf_class_rep1.jpg" width="700" ></li>
      <li>Next, I applied both SMOTE (oversampling the minority class at a 0.5 ratio) and random undersampling of the majority class. While this boosted recall to 0.87—meaning the vast majority of fraud cases were detected—it came at the cost of precision dropping to 0.41. In practical terms, many non-fraudulent transactions were now being misclassified as fraud.</li>
                <img src="rf_class_rep2.jpg" width="700" ></li>
      <li>Finally, I tried to remove undersampling and reduce the SMOTE ratio from 0.5 to 0.1. I then used the Precision–Recall curve to identify the optimal decision threshold for maximizing the F1 score. With this tuned setup, the model struck a better balance, yielding a precision of 0.766 and a recall of 0.723.
         <img src="rf_class_rep3.jpg" width="700" ></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>📊 Evaluating the Random forest Model: ROC & AUC and PR Curve,</h3>
  
      <h4>PR Curve</h4>
  <img src="PR_Cuver_rf.png" width="350" alt="RF Confusion Matrix">
   <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> At very low recall , we can get near-perfect precision, but beyond ~0.7 recall precision dips below 0.8. The red dot marks the threshold (≈0.73) that maximizes F₁, giving us about precision ≈ 0.77 and recall ≈ 0.73. Thus, we can strike a balance—catch roughly 73% of frauds while still being right about 77% of the time.</p>
           
     <h4>ROC Curve</h4>
  <img src="ROC_Curve_rf.png" width="350" alt="RF ROC & AUC">
    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong>The ROC curve shoots almost straight up to a true positive rate (TPR) near 1.0 by the time false positive rate (FPR) is only ~0.1, and the area under curve is 0.99. That indicates nearly perfect rank-ordering of fraud vs. non-fraud by the model.</p>

    <h3>📊 Feature Importance</h3>
      <div>
        <h4>1️⃣ Gini-based Importance</h4>
        <img src="feature_importance_rf.png" width="350" alt="RF Gini Importance">
        
        <h4>2️⃣ Permutation-based Importance</h4>
        <img src="permutation_importance_rf.png" width="350" alt="RF Permutation Importance">
        
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>Both the Gini‐based and permutation‐based importance rankings confirm that transaction amount and category are by far the most influential predictors in Random Forest Model, with the other three features contributing only marginally. The Gini scores  somewhat overstate the gap between amt and category_Code, whereas permutation importance reveals they’re nearly equally critical to model performance. In practice, this means the fraud detector model I built relies almost entirely on those two variables. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

</p>
  <h3>📊 SHAP Analysis ( Fraud Data) </h3>
  <div>
    <img src="SHAP_waterfall1_rf.png" width="700" alt="SHAP Waterfall 1">
  </div>
    <img src="SHAP_waterfall2_rf.png" width="700" alt="SHAP Waterfall 2">
  </div>
    <p><strong> <class="insight">🔍 Interpretation of Waterfall Plot:</strong> In each case, the transaction amount (amt) is the single biggest push (+0.52/ +0.53), followed by the category_Code=2 (+0.45/ +0.46). The age_scaled and job_freq features add only a sliver (+0.01 or less), while gender_le slightly suppresses the score. In short, Random Forest flags these two transactions as fraud almost entirely on the basis of an unusually large amount and a high‐risk category—other features barely move the needle.
  
      <h3>📝 Comment</h3>
  <p> Random Forest achieves near‐perfect discriminative power (ROC-AUC = 0.99), its performance on the minority fraud class (precision = 0.766, recall = 0.723) is relatively high enough to detect credit card fraud compared to logistic model.
